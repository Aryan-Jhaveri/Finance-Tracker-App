As an international student, I had to quickly learn how to manage my finances. 

I have been profecient in excel, but had realised it's limitations when it come's to mobile devices.
  
Unsatisfied with the clustered and complex applications available on various playstores, i set out to find a way to keep using my excel database while having a centralised application that allows me to quickly enter my spendings, and keep track of my personal finances. 

I simply wanted a tool that could do the bare minimum. So, i made one!

I used googles appsheet to develop and host my application

-[Finance Tracker App - Online Web version](https://www.appsheet.com/start/2143f426-a0a4-4804-9fc4-1423fd0bd5cd) Using googles appsheet.

-[Click Here to Install!](https://www.appsheet.com/newshortcut/2143f426-a0a4-4804-9fc4-1423fd0bd5cd)

- The application is centralized, and connected to your google account. Allowing you to access the data from different devices!
